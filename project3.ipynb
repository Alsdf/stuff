You will build a classification model that guesses whether a movie is a comedy or a thriller by using only the number of times chosen words appear in the movie's screenplay. By the end of the project, you should know how to:\n\n1. Build a k-nearest-neighbors classifier.\n2. Test a classifier on data.\n\n### Logistics\n\n**Deadline.**  This project is due at **5:00pm PT on Friday, 4/26**. You can receive 5 bonus points for submitting the project by **5:00pm PT on Thursday, 4/25.** Projects will be accepted up to 1 day (24 hours) late. Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 80% credit. Any submissions later than 24 hours after the deadline will not be accepted. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n\n**Checkpoint.** For full credit on the checkpoint, you must complete the questions up to the checkpoint, **pass all _public_ autograder tests** for those sections, and submit to the Gradescope Project 3 Checkpoint assignment by **5:00pm PT on Friday, 4/19**. <span style=\"color: #BC412B\">**The checkpoint is worth 5% of your entire project grade**</span>. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your project answers before the final project deadline - **only your final submission, to the \"Project 3\" assignment, will be graded for correctness** (including questions from before the checkpoint). You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n\n**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; your partner must be from your assigned lab section. **<span style=\"color: #BC412B\">Only one partner should submit the project notebook to Gradescope.</span> If both partners submit, you will be docked 10% of your project grade. On Gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.** Once you submit, click into your submission, and there will be an option to Add Group Member in the top right corner. You may also reference [this walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POtij6KECSBjCUeOC_F0Lt3ZmKN7LKIq/view?usp=sharing) on how to add partners on Gradescope.\n\n**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n\n**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Ed, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Ed post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](https://www.data8.org/sp24/).\n\n**Tests.** <span style=\"color: #BC412B\">The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly.</span> Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes).\n\n**Free Response Questions:** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. **Every free response question should include an explanation** that adequately answers the question. \n\n**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. \n\nYou **never** have to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!\n\n**All of the concepts necessary for this project are found in the textbook.** If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section will often help to clarify concepts.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"id":"0a306482","cell_type":"markdown","source":"To get started, load `datascience`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

Given some numerical *attributes* (also called *features*) of an unseen example, it decides which category that example belongs to based on its similarity to previously seen examples. Predicting the category of an example is called *labeling*, and the predicted category is also called a *label*.\n\nAn attribute (feature) we have about each movie is *the proportion of times a particular word appears in the movie*, and the labels are two movie genres: comedy and thriller.  The algorithm requires many previously seen examples for which both the attributes and labels are known: that's the `train_movies` table.\n\nTo build understanding, we're going to visualize the algorithm instead of just describing it.","metadata":{}},{"id":"197f5ac6","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.1. Classifying a movie\n\nIn k-NN, we classify a movie by finding the `k` movies in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those movies with similar features the *nearest neighbors*.  The k-NN algorithm assigns the movie to the most common category among its `k` nearest neighbors.\n\nLet's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each movie.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words \"water\" and \"feel\" in the movie.  Taking the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (in the test set), 0.000804074 of its words are \"water\" and 0.0010721 are \"feel\". This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n\nFirst, we need to make our notion of similarity more precise.  **We will say that the *distance* between two movies is the straight-line distance between them when we plot their features on a scatter diagram.**\n\n**This distance is called the Euclidean (\"yoo-KLID-ee-un\") distance, whose formula is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.**\n\nFor example, in the movie *Clerks.* (in the training set), 0.00016293 of all the words in the movie are \"water\" and 0.00154786 are \"feel\".  Its distance from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* on this 2-word feature set is $\\sqrt{(0.000804074 - 0.000162933)^2 + (0.0010721 - 0.00154786)^2} \\approx 0.000798379$.  (If we included more or different features, the distance could be different.)\n\nA third movie, *The Godfather* (in the training set), has 0 \"water\" and 0.00015122 \"feel\". \n\nThe function below creates a plot to display the \"water\" and \"feel\" features of a test movie and some training movies.
